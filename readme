How to init and download project (Window) 

Note: honestly, authRoute is combines both "Controller and Route" --> Must split to other folder.  

1. Install npm (Locally || Globally)  
npm install -g npm@latest 

2. Change to backend folder: cd backend folder

3. Initial the package JSON: npm init -y 

4. npm i express mongoose dotenv jsonwebtoken cloudinary bcryptjs cors
npm i nodemon -D

- Express = simple framework for JS 
- mongoose = Object Data Modeling (ODM) -> use for schema definition, data modeling (create table for mongo)
- dotenv = lib for .env file
- jsonwebtoken = jwt for authentication during sending req to server. 
- cloudinary = store image on 3rd party
- cors = Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. 
- bcryptjs = hash and add "random salt" + compare password   
- nodemon: auto re-run backend server (as dev development)

Note:
a. remember but .env file to .gitignore.
b. npm i: will create the "isolated library" & independences lib for project. Not install globally. 

5. Setup package.json file: 
a. Below keyword --> "type": "module",
b. Inside "scripts", to run the nodemon --> remove the "test" and alternate to "dev": "nodemon src/index.js"

6. Run the server: npm run dev (cd backend)



--------
Run Backend Server:

1. cd backend 

2. npm run dev
